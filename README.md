# ML30Challenge

### The main repository for a 30 day ML learning challenge I'm planning for the semester break!

### Folder Structure

##### Links 
This folder has files with links for external resources. There is a general resources file and also a file for each of the section, with specific resources, which maybe more deeper. We can use these to make our knowledge concrete.

##### Notebooks
This folder has the Jupyter Notebook files for the lessons for each week. These files contain explanations of topics as text and images and gifs and whatnot, and also the code which can be run in the notebook itself. You can copy the notebook into your Google Colaboratory
